WEB TOOL TO ASSIST THE PRACTICE OF NURSES. Tool capable of optimizing the `Nursing Process` in order to improve the quality and agility of patient care.

## Introduction

  The use of technologies in the hospital environment has brought benefits both for the administrative area and for direct patient care with regard to the interpretation of the electrocardiogram, prescription, results reports and the prevention system. In addition, health professionals also make use of computers and mobile devices in order to facilitate the search for information that was previously restricted to books and printed articles.
   The nurse's work consists of a series of assignments that require safe, effective and quality care. One of these attributions is the Nursing Process, which is a methodological tool used to make nursing care organized and systematic, in addition to contributing to the strengthening of the profession as a science, organized into five stages: *Data Collection, Nursing Diagnosis, Nursing Planning, Nursing Implementation and Assessment*. The execution of this Process requires clinical reasoning, decision making and time, especially with regard to nursing records.

## Technologies

  To create this web tool, the `Angular` framework was used, together with the technologies for creating web pages: `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` to create the user view, and the `Django` framework together with the `Python` language for database processing and integration.
